## Problem

Many individuals, including the elderly, autistic children, and post-operative patients, face challenges in verbal communication. Existing communication tools can be complex, visually overwhelming, or expensive. There is a need for an intuitive and affordable solution.

## Solution

SpeakTouch offers a simple and direct way for nonverbal users to express themselves. By performing basic gestures, users can trigger corresponding audio messages and haptic feedback. Examples:

- Swipe Right → "I’m hungry"
- Swipe Left → "Bathroom"
- Double Tap → "Thank you"
- Two-finger Hold → "I need help"

## Target Users

- Elderly individuals experiencing speech loss.
- Autistic children with communication difficulties.
- Patients recovering from surgery affecting speech.

## Technical Overview

The application is built using React and potentially AI for future enhancements. It utilizes native touch events for gesture recognition and integrates TTS libraries like Google TTS or pyttsx3 for audio output. The initial version relies on rule-based logic.

## Future Enhancements

- AI-powered phrase suggestions.
- Customizable user interface themes.
